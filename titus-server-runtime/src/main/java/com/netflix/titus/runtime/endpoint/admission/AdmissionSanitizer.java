/**
 * Sanitizers have a MapReduce-like interface, and are executed concurrently in two phases:
 * <p>
 * 1. <tt>sanitize(input)</tt> is called on all registered {@link AdmissionSanitizer sanitizers} concurrently. The input
 * parameter may or may not have passed through other sanitizers, no assumptions on what data has been already changed
 * during the sanitization process can be made. It is safer to assume no other sanitizers should touch the same data,
 * and the input is the original value sent to the system. The behavior with multiple sanitizers with overlapping
 * updates is unspecified.
 * <p>
 * 2. The previous call returns a {@link Function} that applies a partial update, and partial updates are chained
 * through all sanitizers sequentially. Each sanitizer adds its partial update to the entity modified by its
 * predecessor in the chain. The final result includes all partial updates from all sanitizers. No assumptions should be
 * made on the order in which sanitizers will be called.
