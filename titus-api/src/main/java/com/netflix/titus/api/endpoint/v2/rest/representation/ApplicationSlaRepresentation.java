/**
 * Application SLA model for v2 REST API. Each job type (service, batch) can be scheduled in any tier.
 * <p>
 * <h1>Capacity guarantee</h1>
 * An application has to define resources required by their tasks. It is expected (but not verified yet), that
 * all application's jobs will include the resource allocations identical to those requested in SLA.
 * Together with resource dimensions, the application SLA defines a total number of instances it expects to
 * require for peek allocation. This is not a constraint, and the application can ask for more resources, but
 * these may not be readily available, and may require scale up action. If scale-up is not possible, as maximum
 * size of the agent server group is reached, application's excessive tasks will be queued.
 * <p>
 * <h1>Fitness</h1>
 * Agent cluster allocation is based on job fitness criteria (how well its resources match a given instance type).
 * As service job is expected always to run on an instance available within its tier, it may be a mismatch between fitness
 * calculated best-agent, and the SLA-level restriction. To resolve this, a global constraint is provided that
 * restricts the application to run on instance types from within its tier.
 * <p>
 * <h1>Agent cluster assignment</h1>
 * It is expected that only one agent server group per instance type exists. This can be not true however under
 * certain circumstances, like Titus agent redeployment. If there are multiple clusters deployed with the same
 * instance type, the sum of their resources is checked against expected SLA resource level. If not sufficient
 * resources are present, any of those clusters (one or many) may be chosen for scale-up action
 * (setting new min-ASG level).
